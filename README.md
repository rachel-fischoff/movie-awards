# Overview 

## Shoppies Movie Awards
The goal of this project is to create a web page that uses [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and allow the user to save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

The project is deployed through [Netlify](https://rachel-fischoff-movie-awards.netlify.app/) and can be found at https://rachel-fischoff-movie-awards.netlify.app/

## How Does it Work?
Upon opening the web page, the user can search for their favorite films in the search bar & then nominate up to 5 films for awards season. 

## Next Steps
1. Create Sharable Links
1. Pagination
1. Add Testing 
1. Animations for loading

# Requirements To Set Up Locally
1. A command line application such as Terminal.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control and a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
    - You can check to see if Git is already installed on your computer by typing `git --version` into your command line application. If it is installed it will list the currently installed version (e.g. `git version 2.18.0`).
    - If you prefer to use a GUI to work with version control, GitHub offers a [free desktop app](https://desktop.github.com).
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a programming environment powered by JavaScript.
    - You can check to see if Node.js is already installed on your computer by typing `node -v` into your command line application. If it is installed it will list the currently installed version (e.g. `v10.2.1`). 
    - It may also be helpful to use a program such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to help manage your Node.js versions. This will ensure that the version of Node.js your computer uses to run various things won't conflict with an updated version.
