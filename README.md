# Overview 

## Shoppies Movie Awards
The goal of this project is to create a web page that uses [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and allow the user to save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

The project is deployed through [Netlify](https://rachel-fischoff-movie-awards.netlify.app/) and can be found at https://rachel-fischoff-movie-awards.netlify.app/

## How Does it Work?
Upon opening the web page, the user can search for their favorite films in the search bar & then nominate up for 5 for awards season. 

# Requirements To Set Up Locally
1. A command line application such as Terminal.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control and a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
    - You can check to see if Git is already installed on your computer by typing `git --version` into your command line application. If it is installed it will list the currently installed version (e.g. `git version 2.18.0`).
    - If you prefer to use a GUI to work with version control, GitHub offers a [free desktop app](https://desktop.github.com).
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), a programming environment powered by JavaScript.
    - You can check to see if Node.js is already installed on your computer by typing `node -v` into your command line application. If it is installed it will list the currently installed version (e.g. `v10.2.1`). 
    - It may also be helpful to use a program such as [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to help manage your Node.js versions. This will ensure that the version of Node.js your computer uses to run various things won't conflict with an updated version.

## Clone project locally 
1. Clone this repository by entering this command into your command line application: `git clone https://github.com/rachel-fischoff/movie-awards.git`. 
1. Navigate to into the projects root directory by typing `cd movie-awards`
1. Install the project's dependencies and modules by typing `npm install` into your command line application. A list of these modules should be displayed after their downloaded. 

## Running the project
After cloning and installing project dependencies, type `npm start` into your command line application. The will tell you Node.js to compile the project and turn into a website.

## Accessing the project in your browser
After `npm start` the command line will let you know that the website is compile successfully! And that you view `movie-awards` in your browser. [http://localhost:3000]( http://localhost:3000)


# Boilerplate Information
Everything in this section is automatically generated when you create a new app using `create-react-app`. These details can be really helpful in learning how to launch and manage your React app with `npm`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
